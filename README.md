# C-Sharp Projects
 C# Projects as I learn
This is for some C# projects and assignments as I learn the language and more learning using Visual Studio.
As I have progressed through, I have come to the realisation there is more problem solving than memorising code, knowing what 
to do where is just as important as what you type in.
